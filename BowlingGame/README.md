**Create a bowling game score calculator

A game has 10 frames, each frame has two rolls. If a strike is rolled,
the frame is over and the sum of the next two rolls + an additional 10
points are the score for that frame.

On a spare, the first throw of the next frame is also counted into the
score of the current frame.
